    <h2>Ultimate Moist Carrot Cake with Cream Cheese Frosting</h2>
    <p>
      For an even more indulgent and flavorful carrot cake, I‚Äôve added a few
      tweaks that elevate the taste and texture. With hints of brown butter,
      extra spices, and a bit of orange zest, this version is rich, aromatic,
      and simply irresistible!

        (optional)
      </li>
      <li>50 g unsweetened coconut flakes (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For the Cream Cheese Frosting</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>250 g cream cheese, softened</li>
      <li>150 g unsalted butter, softened</li>
      <li>250 g icing sugar</li>
      <li>5 ml vanilla extract</li>
      <li>10-15 g orange juice (or to taste)</li>
      <li>A pinch of salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 180¬∞C (160¬∞C for fan-assisted). Grease and line a
        23cm round cake tin with baking paper.
      </li>
      <li>
        If using walnuts or pecans, toast them in a dry pan over medium heat for
        3-5 minutes until fragrant and golden. Let them cool before chopping.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a small pan, melt the butter over medium heat and cook until it turns
        golden brown and smells nutty, about 3-5 minutes. Allow it to cool
        slightly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sift the plain flour, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda, cinnamon,
        nutmeg, ginger, and salt into a large bowl. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        In another bowl, whisk the eggs, caster sugar, brown sugar, vanilla
        extract, orange zest, and browned butter until smooth and creamy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, folding gently
        until fully combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in the grated carrots, walnuts, sultanas, and coconut flakes (if
        using). Mix until evenly combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the batter into the prepared cake tin and smooth the top. Bake for
        45-55 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out
        clean. Let the cake cool in the tin for 10 minutes before transferring
        to a wire rack to cool completely.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beat the softened cream cheese and butter together until light and
        fluffy. Gradually sift in the icing sugar and continue to beat until
        smooth. Add the vanilla extract, orange juice, and a pinch of salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the cake is completely cooled, spread the cream cheese frosting
        over the top. You can also frost the sides of the cake if desired.
        Decorate with additional chopped walnuts or pecans, or candied orange
        peel.
      </li>
      <li>
        Slice and enjoy this rich, moist carrot cake with a cup of tea or
        coffee!
      </li>
    </ol>

      frosting‚Äîideal for any occasion! ü•ïüç∞
